Please generate the following 5 character portraits (16:9 aspect ratio) of the SAME Siamese man; keep his face consistent across all images. If you can only generate one image per turn, generate #1 first and I will say "next" for the rest.

Every image MUST strictly follow this exact STYLE & HISTORICAL RULE BLOCK:
"Historical illustration of everyday life in Siam (Ayutthaya kingdom), mid-18th century. Muted earthy watercolor and ink on textured paper, soft natural daylight, restrained palette of ochre, indigo, rust and off-white. Grounded, documentary, ordinary weathered faces without makeup. Unless stated otherwise, Siamese adults of both sexes wear their black hair cropped level with the top of the ears, the hair below shaved close, lifted off the forehead, and their teeth are blackened from chewing betel. A well-to-do woman's wrap cloth is wrapped horizontally around the chest, its two ends thrown back over both shoulders. Commoner houses are small, of woven split-bamboo panels raised on tall bamboo piles, entered by a short bamboo ladder hanging from the doorway by ropes with its foot off the ground. Children under eleven have shaved heads with a small topknot of hair left on the crown and wear traditional woven lower cloths. Avoid: modern clothing or objects, tourist-poster look, fantasy costume, glossy digital rendering, glamour or model-like faces, makeup, buns or topknots on adult women, long loose hair, bob haircuts, one-shoulder diagonal sash, modern Thai costume, tiled roofs or ornate gable finials on commoner houses, ladders leaning on the ground."

Composition for every image: ONE person only, no other people in frame; framed from the waist or chest up, face in the upper third of the image and fully visible, simple background of the setting described; the image will be cropped to a 16:9 window aligned near the top.

(16:9 aspect ratio)

Image 2 (`portrait.m.adult.commoner`):
